<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sumit!</h1>

**`"Su" from sushi and "mit" from Mitsubishi`**

A freshly graduated business student and an incoming software engineer at a Japanese multinational firm (April 2024). I am driven by a desire to contribute to society through Machine Learning and AI. As such, I am passionate about engaging in discussions regarding career transitions into the dynamic field of AI and breaking into the tech industry. 

I like doing random AI projects, uploading them to GitHub, and sharing my struggles and understandings on LinkedIn. I love learning, and I rejoice in the struggle of learning difficult things. It's through navigating these complex problems that innovation and creativity flourish.
